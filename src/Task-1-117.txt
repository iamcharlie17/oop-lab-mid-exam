Code Smells:
1. Improper Naming, inventorySystem class starts with lower case
2. Long Class: inventorySystem class contains too many responsibilities.
3. Long Method: addProduct, processOrder, and GenerateInventoryReport methods are too long.
4. Feature Envy: inventorySystem directly manipulate the globalInventoryData
5. (85, 87, 91 in inventorySystem.java), Magic Numbers, in calculateFinalPrice there are many magic numbers.
6. (range: 104 --> 130), Duplicate Code, Repeated logic for calculating total values
7. (17 in inventorySystem), Primitive Obsession, using string for discount type rather enum
8. (132 --> 155), Lack of Error Handling, in processOrder method there is no exceptions to handle error
9. , God class, globalInventoryData class acting like a god class
10. (51, 61, 62, 146), Incomplete Encapsulation, manipulating product.id directly without using setter/getter
11. Violating encapsulation, globalInventoryData class expose all fields as public
12. (9 --> 13 in globalInventory class), Global state, too many static fields
13. Lack of SRP, inventorySystem and globalInventoryData are handling too many concerns.
14. Tight coupling, inventorySystem is tightly coupled to globalInventoryData and Warehouse.
15.
